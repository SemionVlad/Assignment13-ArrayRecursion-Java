## Overview

This repository contains my solution to **Assignment 13** for the course *20454 - Introduction to Computer Science in Java*.  
The focus of this assignment was on recursive thinking and implementation without the use of loops or helper classes.

The repository includes solutions to **two main questions**, each focusing on recursive strategies.

## Question 1: `countEqualDiff(int[] arr, int diff)`

**Objective**:  
Find and print all valid disjoint complementary partitions of the input array such that both:

- `|sum(A) - sum(B)| == diff`
- `|size(A) - size(B)| == diff`

**Constraints**:

- Must be implemented recursively.
- No use of loops or collections.
- Duplicate elements are not allowed in the input.

**Output format**:

{a1 a2 ...} sum = X count = N {b1 b2 ...} sum = Y count = M

## Question 2: `minPoints(int[][] mat)`

**Objective**:  
Determine the minimum initial energy required to travel from the top-left to the bottom-right cell of a 2D matrix, moving only right or down, without the energy level dropping below 1 at any point.

**Key Details**:

- Recursive strategy with memoization.
- The matrix contains both positive and negative values.
- Energy must always remain â‰¥ 1.
